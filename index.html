    <h1>Cats vs Dogs: the Definitive Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the ultimate showdown between cats and dogs. May the best one win!</p>
    <div class="cats">
      <p>Here's why cats are great. Cats have a unique kind of cuteness. They show affection through their large green eyes, they depict playfulness by chasing laser lights and toy spiders, and they become a part of your home. Whether cats want you to buzz off, entertain them, give them food, or show them TV, they have a specific way of meowing for each activity. A slow, lulled meow signals that they want you to pet them under their necks. A short purr lets you know that they are impressed. A loud, continuous meow is their way of asking you to "get the hell out of here!" It is difficult to think of anything cuter than this.</p>

      <p>Here's why dogs are great. As a furry pup lover, there is no doubt in my mind that having a dog brings many upsides to my life. I mean, how can I NOT live happily waking up to a smiley face and wagging tail? For those of you who do not yet have a furry friend, or who are planning on adding one to your family, youâ€™ll be glad to hear that there are scientifically proven benefits that dogs bring to each of our lives!.</p>
